## Problem Scope
In institutions such as NUS, event organisers often provide freebie giveaways, such as in the form of free goodie bags or catered buffet food for their events. While this may be an incentive to attract potential members of the public to attend their events, overproduction of freebies often occurs, which leads to waste of food or other items which could potentially have been given out.

At the same time, many members of the public are attracted to the notion of freebies, and often do not mind travelling to get a free meal, or perhaps a few vouchers. These people could potentially help to reduce the amount of materials wasted by attending these events to clear the uncollected freebies.

## Our Solution
Free4All aims to tackle both problems by providing to the public a real-time map of current giveaways in the user’s vicinity, and also providing a platform for event organisers or other members of the public to share current or upcoming freebie giveaways. 

By making use of a device’s location, the app can display all nearby giveaways, and also provide notifications should a giveaway be nearby (only for subscribed categories).

People can also share a giveaway if they are organising an event and wish to attract more audience members by using freebies as incentives. Others can also share giveaways if they come across one, in order to “give back” to the community and share good stuff with others. Also, the status of the giveaway can also be updated, such as low stock levels or if the event is ending soon, making the app as real-time as possible.

We also wish provide a gamification system, whereby people get points simply by attending giveaways (via checking-in), updating event statuses, voting/giving user reviews, sharing events to the community, or by having other users checking in at the giveaway posted on our platform. We can also incorporate a leaderboard and unlockable achievements/badges, similar to that of StackExchange.
